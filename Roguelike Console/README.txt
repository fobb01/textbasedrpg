This is the beginning of a roguelike project

This is just for fun and is not intended to be secure, etc..

I plan to create a "board" using two dimmensional arrays with classes to define each element of the array.

The main four classes will be: player, object, dungeon, and monster.

There will be differing types of each basic archetype using inheritence to ensure variability and create many types of objects. 

Save data will be written to a specific file of the folder saves.
