This is the beginning of a roguelike project

This is just for fun and is not intended to be secure, etc..

I plan to create a "board" using two dimmensional arrays with classes to define each element of the array.

The four main super classes will be mob, item, and dungeon.

There will be differing types of each basic archetype using inheritence to ensure variability and create many types of objects. 

Save data will be written to a specific file of the folder saves.
